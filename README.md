# Logic Building with Python 🧠🐍

This repository is a **logic-first Python practice roadmap** designed to build strong problem-solving skills before jumping into Data Science, Machine Learning, or interviews.

Most beginners fail not because of syntax, but because they cannot break problems into steps. This repo fixes that.

## Why this repository exists

I am following a long-term Data Science roadmap.
Before touching NumPy, Pandas, or ML models, I need **strong Python logic**.

This repository focuses on:

* Thinking before coding
* Writing clean, readable logic
* Solving problems without memorizing solutions

No shortcuts. No copy-paste learning.

---

## Repository structure

Each week has its **own Jupyter Notebook**.

```
logic-building-with-python/
│
├── Week_01_Python_Basics.ipynb
├── Week_02_Functions_Collections.ipynb
├── Week_03_File_Error_Modules.ipynb
├── Week_04_Logic_Strings.ipynb
```

---

## How each notebook is designed

Every problem follows the same strict structure:

1. **Problem Statement**
   What exactly needs to be solved.

2. **Deep Explanation (No code)**

   * What the problem is testing
   * How to think about it logically
   * Common mistakes to avoid

3. **One Empty Code Cell**

   * No solution provided
   * I write code myself
   * Forces active thinking

This is intentional. Passive learning is useless.

## Weekly focus breakdown

### Week 1: Python Basics

* Variables and data types
* Conditions and loops
* Number logic (palindrome, prime, factorial)
* Input and output handling

Goal: Think in steps, not syntax.

---

### Week 2: Functions & Collections

* Functions and return values
* Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
* Frequency counting and transformations

Goal: Break logic into reusable blocks.

---

### Week 3: Files, Errors & Comprehensions

* File handling
* Exception handling
* List comprehensions and generators

Goal: Write safer, cleaner Python code.

---

### Week 4: Logic Building & Strings

* String manipulation
* Pattern and text-based logic
* Edge cases and constraints

Goal: Sharpen pure problem-solving ability.

---

## How to use this repo (important)

This repo is **not** meant to be rushed.

Recommended workflow:

1. Read the problem
2. Read the explanation slowly
3. Think on paper first
4. Then write code in the empty cell
5. Refactor after it works

If you jump straight to code, you’re cheating yourself.

---

## Who this repo is for

* Beginners who want **strong fundamentals**
* Data Science or ML aspirants
* Students preparing for coding interviews
* Anyone tired of tutorial hell

If you want quick solutions, this repo is not for you.

---

## Future plans

* Add advanced logic problems
* Time and space complexity notes
* Interview-style constraints
* Transition to NumPy and Pandas logic

---

## Final note

Good developers are not fast typists.
They are **clear thinkers**.

This repository is about building that clarity.
